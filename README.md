# AI Crypto Advisor
This repository contains a full‑stack web application for the Moveo coding task.

## Features
* Authentication – users can register and log in using email and password. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication.
* Onboarding quiz – after first login, users answer a few questions about their favourite crypto assets, investor type and preferred content categories. Answers are stored in the database.
* Daily dashboard – once onboarding is complete, users see a dashboard with four sections:
  * Market News: top crypto headlines from CryptoPanic with a static fallback.
  * Coin Prices: live USD prices and 24‑hour percentage change for the user’s selected assets via CoinGecko.
  * AI Insight: a short, actionable daily insight generated by a configurable LLM endpoint Hugging Face. A fallback is used if the endpoint is not configured.
  * Fun Meme: a randomly selected crypto meme image.
* Feedback buttons – each section has 👍 and 👎 buttons. Votes are persisted so you can later train a ranking model or tailor future recommendations.
* API first – the backend exposes RESTful endpoints under `/api` for authentication, preferences, dashboard and feedback.
* Clean UI – the frontend is built with React and Vite and styled with a dark theme. It works on desktop and mobile.

## Getting started locally
The backend uses Node.js, Express and SQLite. The frontend uses React** and Vite. Follow these steps to run both in development:

1. Clone the repository and install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set JWT_SECRET and optionally AI_API_URL, AI_API_TOKEN and CRYPTOPANIC_TOKEN
   ```

3. Start the backend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The API will listen on `http://localhost:4000` by default and create a `database.sqlite` file on first run.

4. In another terminal, install frontend dependencies and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. During development, Vite proxies API requests to the backend.

5. Open the app in your browser, register a new user and complete the onboarding quiz. You should then see your personalized dashboard.

## AI tools usage
This solution was planned with the help of AI (ChatGPT) to sketch the architecture, database schema and API structure. The code itself is hand written to match the task requirements. A configurable AI endpoint is used to generate the daily insight. The default is a Hugging Face inference endpoint. You can plug in any compatible model by setting `AI_API_URL` and `AI_API_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.

## Bonus: feedback training suggestions
Every time a user clicks 👍 or 👎 the app stores a record in the `feedback` table with the user id, content type, content id and vote. To leverage this data for future improvements, you could implement a daily job that aggregates feedback and computes a score for each item or source (e.g. average score per news source, per coin). A simple ranking model could combine these scores with the user's stated preferences to prioritize content that similar users have found helpful. Over time, this would make the dashboard increasingly personalized without any manual tuning.
